# coolade

All this does right now is copy a `RULES.md` from one place to the paths listed in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "paths": ["~/.claude/CLAUDE.md", "~/.codex/AGENTS.md"]
}
```

## Usage

```bash
node sync
```

Note: you should probably just use [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) and [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)
