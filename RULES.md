- Use as few lines of code as possible while preserving features
- Sort object keys and CSS properties alphabetically
- In HTML and JSX markup, use id to name tags when there is exactly one of that element
- In CSS, use rems only when the value is whole or ends in .25, .5, .75
- Use one-liners where possible while keeping code readable
- Use latest JS features like arrow functions, optional chaining, etc.
